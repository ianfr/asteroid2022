# Asteroid Simulation
## About
Asteroid simulation with gravity, collisions, and cohesion. Written in Fortran 2008. Tested with gfortran and Intel Fortan on Ubuntu x64.

## Goals
* Generate asteroids made of point particles according to the user specification
* Generate data for easy post-processing, and/or generate plots right from Fortran
* Simulate the motion of the particles under gravity
* Perform collision detection
* Implement cohesion
* Parallelize
